# WebCell

A browser-based cell simulation using WebGL, React, and an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.

## Project Goal

Simulate a population of cells that divide, mutate, and compete for limited resources in a user-controlled environment.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/akbak/WebCell.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd WebCell
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will open the simulation in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.
